# JAsteroids
An asteroids clone in Java.

## Description:
This is a game based on the Asteroids arcade space shooter released in 
November 1979 by Atari, Inc. and designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, 
and Dominic Walsh.

Your mission is basically to reduce the floating asteroids down to rubble and 
finally dust. Each asteroid when shot breaks into two smaller ones.  The waves
of meteors is neverending, so the game only ends when your supply of ships
runs out or you get bored and close the window.

## How to Compile
This code was pushed using Eclipse, so you should be able to clone the 
repository and open it in Eclipse, compile and run it there. 

## The Controls
Left Arrow - Rotate ship left
Right Arrow - Rotate ship right
Up Arrow - Thrust
Space Bar - Shoot
